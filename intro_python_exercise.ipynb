    "Libraries are pre-written chunks of code designed to be integrated into projects for a specific purpose.  The idea is to keep people from having to reinvent the wheel every time they want to write a program.  When we encounter situations where a libary might be useful, we use the keyword *import* to tell the program that we want to use this pre-existing code.  As an example, in the next section you will use a library called Pandas which helps visualize data and make it easier to digest, which is very useful for us.  Because of this, we will import that code into this program simply by running the cell with the import that goes with that code.  Here is what you will see, only in commented code."
